> Avery professional way of writing web page better then what is use before.

| _Step Name_ | User Story | Changes in HTML | Changes in CSS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| __Live Boilerplate__ | **As** an enthusiastic HYF student I can navigate to an empty website so that I know the project is set up correctly | An empty template project with `doctype`, language, charset, `head` & `body` | An empty folder |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Writing fist HTML highlight codes__ | **Creating** a guide line code, before starting with complete code is making work easy and understandable give a wide range of arris to work and think for every section of page | familiar names `Header` `container` `showcase` `section` `footer` `div` `button` `nav` making your midi auto fix, what goes where! | An empty folder |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Creating CSS file__ | **After** completing `index.html` and knowing every `section` and parts of html it is easy to write `CSS` codes and use them for more then one `section` i did not writie for every `tag` separate `CSs` code | `form` `input` `button` `aside` | Created CSS file for `index.html` & linked it to `index.html` |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Writing About me page__| **Nice** to know i can write all `CSS` codes for one project in one single `CSS` page, and i don't have to write a lot of codes just simple changes | (what did you add to the HTML?) | Creating `dark` and `sidebar` classes and update some bug from my `CSS` file |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Creating Service page__ | For making Service it is similar to About page but i learn making `form` in `HTML5` is easy | `form`, `label` for email `textara` for writing text with `placeholder` & `button` to submit | `width` & `padding` for `sidebar` and its `text` `li` rules for `services` ID and `ul` |
|  | |  |  |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| __Responsiveness of page as per user device__ | **Knowing** that we can usd one ``media` code for complete project is nice, and adding every `ID` `class` just using `.` but for some individual we can make as set of rules in same `media` | Nothing | `@media` rules for complete project |
